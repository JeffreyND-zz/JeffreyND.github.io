<h3 align="center"> Elevator Description: </h3>
<p align="center"> The elevator I am evaluating is located within the 25Twenty apartment complex. 
There wasn't many issues with this elevator in regards to design. If anything, the elevator buttons
should be aligned vertically to make it easier to understand the layout of the building floors.
Additionaly it might be wiser to have a greater contrast between the elevator pane and the buttons to
make it easier to locate and press each button.</p>

<h4> Common uses of elevator: </h4>
<ul>
  <li> Navigate Up </li>
  <li> Navigate Down </li>
  <li> Force elevator to open doors </li>
  <li> Force elevator to close doors </li>
</ul>

<h4> Rare uses of elevator: </h4>
<ul>
  <li> Signal an emergency </li>
  <li> Call for help </li>
</ul>

<h3 align="center"> More about the elevator: </h3>
<p align="center"> The elevator I'm examining can be utilized for both common and uncommon uses. 
Using the elevator is intuitive: press a button that represents the floor you would like to go to,
wait for the elevator to move to that floor, and then simply get out of the elevator. The elevator
that I'm examining provides feedback to the user by lighting up a selected button. If I could make
suggestions to improve the elevator design, I would align the floor buttons vertically and have a
single 'aid' button to be used for help & emergencies.</p>
