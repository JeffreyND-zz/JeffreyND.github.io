<h3 align="center"> Elevator Description: </h3>
<p align="center"> The elevator I am evaluating is located within the 25Twenty apartment complex. 
There wasn't many issues with this elevator in regards to design. If anything, the elevator buttons
should be aligned vertically to make it easier to understand the layout of the building floors.
Additionaly it might be wiser to have a greater contrast between the elevator pane and the buttons to
make it easier to locate and press each button.</p>

<h3 align="center"> More about the elevator: </h3>
<p align="center"> The elevator I'm examining can be utilized for both common and uncommon uses. 
Using the elevator is intuitive: press a button that represents the floor you would like to go to,
wait for the elevator to move to that floor, and then simply get out of the elevator. The elevator
that I'm examining provides feedback to the user by lighting up a selected button. If I could make
suggestions to improve the elevator design, I would align the floor buttons vertically and have a
single 'aid' button to be used for help & emergencies.</p>

<h1> For An A: <h1>
<h3 align="center"> My simple touchscreen design: </h3>
<img src="https://github.com/JeffreyND/JeffreyND.github.io/blob/master/hw1/img1.png" align="center" />
<p align="center"> The design includes button layouts of the left-hand side of the screen and an information section on the right side of the screen. </p>
  <h4 align="center"> The Buttons </h4>
  <p align="center"> For my design, I decided to represent six floors. The buttons aligned vertically to represent the corresponding floor levels. A “help” button also exists if the user needs any assistance.
For my design, I tried to minimize the number of buttons to reduce complexity and make it easier for the users to utilize the functionalities of the elevator. </p>
  </br>
  <h4 align="center"> Feedback </h4>
  <p align="center"> When the user selects a button, the button is highlighted, and a sound is played. Doing so allows the user to receive feedback from their action and make it easier to understand which floors the elevator will eventually navigate to. Additionally, the right side of the screen serves as an informational section and displays the current floor of the elevator, the action the elevator is performing, and a simple graphic to represent the current action of the elevator. </p>
